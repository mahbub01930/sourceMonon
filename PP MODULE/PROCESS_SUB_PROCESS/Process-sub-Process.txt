DB Procedure : 

Other Instructions
API Sub-task 7: FA recommended a change which needed to make changes in create, update & get_process_list controller method
For API to do:

add validation for 'is_core_activity' as 'Y' or 'N' - default is 'Y'
make changes in create & update controller method.
in 'get_process_list' controller method add two more fields in return data set.


FA: 

Testing is done. all are ok. Two thing is needed:
In left panel, list box, Process and sub-process should be present in different color, so that user can recognize who is the process and who is the sub process
New Column Added into PP_PROCESS_CONFIG table named IS_CORE_ACTIVITY. It will contain Y/N value, By default it will be "Y"
